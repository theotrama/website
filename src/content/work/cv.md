## Work Experience

### Julius Baer — Zurich, Switzerland
**Tech Lead, Full Time** | Nov 2022 – Present

- Led the technical go-live of a new enterprise application, owning the full lifecycle from requirements analysis to architecture, implementation, and production rollout.
- Designed and implemented backend services with Java (Spring Boot 3, JDK 21) ensuring scalable, reliable integrations across multiple systems.
- Championed API-first development by introducing OpenAPI-driven REST client generation, eliminating manual frontend client code and improving cross-team consistency.
- Enhanced developer experience and CI/CD test reliability with WireMock and Testcontainers, spinning up near-production environments including Oracle database.
- Improved deployment consistency and scalability by containerizing applications and services with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Migrated a legacy application from Kerberos to OAuth2, improving auth transparency and simplifying system setup.
- Modernized frontend stack by upgrading to React 18, TanStack Query, and Vite. Implemented reusable Micro Frontends via Module Federation, including a graph theory based partner tree visualization using React Flow.
- Actively promoted engineering excellence by presenting best practices and new technologies at bank-wide developer exchanges.

### Rheinmetall Cyber Solutions — Bremen, Germany
**Software Engineer, Full Time** | Feb 2021 – Oct 2022

- Designed and deployed a fault-tolerant three-node Kafka cluster, tuning partitions and replication factors of the topics for throughput and resilience. Implemented Kafka Streams consumers to classify IP addresses, enabling a new licensing model.
- Improved stability and throughput of a distributed transaction system by isolating ActiveMQ into a standalone container, simplifying code and doubling transaction speed.
- Defined and aligned gRPC service contracts across the team and implemented the backend services in Spring Boot.
